To Do List 2.0

This is a simple to-do list app that allows you to create tasks, mark them as important, edit them, mark them as complete, undo in case you accidentaly mark a task as complete, and delete them.

This app is made with Flutter and uses shared preferences to store the tasks. 

Currently working on adding a set of kill sounds from valorant for the task completion, and other custom sounds for mark as important, undo and delete as well. Aim to eventually change the UI to make it resemble the boon selection menu from the game Hades (by Supergiant Games).
